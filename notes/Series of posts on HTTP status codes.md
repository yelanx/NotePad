Because I want to get into the habit of blogging on a regular basis, I thought it would be a fun idea to write a series of articles on one of my favourite topics: HTTP and Webservices.

To start, I began writing an article for every HTTP status code. I only realized after I drafted the first few, that the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) page actually lists 68 official ones. Definitely a bit more than I thought, but I started and I’m going to see if I can finish it.

I’m going to release the first few this week, and then switch to a weekly schedule. Hopefully I can keep this going for a year!

Today I published the first one: [100 Continue](https://evertpot.com/http/100-continue).
