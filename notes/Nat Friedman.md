> A few things about me

I'm an investor, entrepreneur, developer.

Some things about me:

*   Grew up in Charlottesville, VA
*   On the Internet since 1991, which is my actual "home town"
*   Went to MIT because I loved the Richard Feynman [autobiographies](https://www.amazon.com/Richard-P-Feynman/e/B000AQ47U8/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1)
*   Started [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian) [companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin)
*   CEO of [GitHub](https://github.com/) from 2018 through 2021
*   Live in California
*   Working on reading the [Herculaneum Papyri](https://scrollprize.org/)
*   Tested 300 Bay Area foods for [plastic chemicals](https://plasticlist.org/)

Some things I believe:

*   As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences

*   Technology, which is really [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity), enables this
*   You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor

*   Enthusiasm matters!

*   It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
*   It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
*   Energy is a necessary input for progress

*   It's important to do things fast

*   You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
*   Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit
*   "Slow is fake"
*   A week is 2% of the year
*   Time is the denominator

*   The efficient market hypothesis is a lie

*   At best it is a very lossy heuristic
*   The best things in life occur where EMH is wrong
*   In many cases it's more accurate to model the world as 500 people than 8 billion
*   "Most people are other people"

*   We know less than we think

*   The replication crisis is not an aberration
*   Many of the things we believe are wrong
*   We are often not even asking the right questions

*   The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful

*   Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgment
*   The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension
*   The downsides are worth it

*   Smaller teams are better

*   Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun
*   No need to chop up work for political reasons
*   No room for mediocre people (can pay more, too!)
*   Large-scale engineering projects are more soluble in IQ than they appear
*   Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed

*   Where do you get your dopamine?

*   The answer is predictive of your behavior
*   Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
*   It's ok to get yours from"making things happen"

*   You can do more than you think

*   We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy
*   The laws of physics are the only limit
